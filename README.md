## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Coe editor for android8

### What I learned

During the process of doing this challenge, I learnt a whole lot

Some things I learnt include

1. How to add a shape using html and css, in this case, it was a square so I used :

```html
(html)
<div class="square">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</div>
```
```css
(css)
.square {width: 200px;
        height: 300px;
        border: 1px white;
        position:absolute;
        background-color: white;
        border-radius: 10%}
```
The above code gave a rectangle as showm below ðŸ‘‡


<div>
    <img style="width:100px; height:150px;" src="/storage/emulated/0/Download/qr-code-component-main/Screenshot_20230321-210155.png">
</div>

2. How to add image using html
```html
(html)
<div>
    <img src="/storage/emulated/0/Download/qr-code-component-main/Screenshot_20230321-210155.png">
</div>
```
The above code imported the image from the location and displayed it.The image was already saved in my device so I used this (```src="/storage/emulated/0/Download/qr-code-component-main/Screenshot_20230321-210155.png"```) to point the html to the location of the image to be displayed

3. How to change font size, background-color, text-alignment and more using css

```CSS
(css)
.square {font-size: 15px;
        background-color: white;
        text-alignment: center;
        font-weight:bold;
        color:blue;}
```

### Continued development

This being my first coding work, I am yet to get an area of focus. I belive that subsequently I'll get to find an area to focus on 

### Useful resources

- [Chatgpt](http://chat.openai.com) - This helped me with basic codes to draw square shape. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
